üß† Machine Learning Analysis on Drosophila melanogaster
===========================================================

This project demonstrates the application of supervised machine learning techniques to analyze biological data related to _Drosophila melanogaster_ (fruit flies). The focus is on classifying biological outcomes based on various input features, using several machine learning models, and evaluating their performance.

üìå Project Overview
-------------------

The goal of this analysis is to predict categorical outcomes in _Drosophila melanogaster_ based on different input features. The analysis involves:

*   Data preprocessing and cleaning
*   Feature selection and engineering
*   Training multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors)
*   Evaluating models using performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
*   Visualizing model results with confusion matrices, feature importance, and performance plots

* * *

üß™ Technologies Used
--------------------

*   **Python 3.x**
*   **Jupyter Notebook** for the main analysis
*   **NumPy** for numerical operations
*   **Pandas** for data manipulation
*   **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
*   **scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation

* * *

  

‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
---------------------

To set up the project on your local machine, follow the instructions below:

### 1\. Clone the repository

  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MLAnalysisDrosophila.git
  cd MLAnalysisDrosophila
  

### 2\. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment

  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate         # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
  

### 3\. Install the required dependencies

If you have a `requirements.txt` file:

  pip install -r requirements.txt
  

Otherwise, you can install the dependencies manually:

  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
  

### 4\. Launch the Jupyter notebook

  jupyter notebook MLAnalysisDrosophila.ipynb

üìä Example Outputs
------------------

The Jupyter notebook generates several types of output:

*   **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix to evaluate the classification accuracy of the models.
*   **Feature Importance Plot**: Visualizations that show which features contribute most to the model's decisions.
*   **Model Performance Metrics**: Comparison of multiple models based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
